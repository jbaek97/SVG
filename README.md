# SVG

## Description:
  This application is logo generator that takes user input and makes a logo svg file accordingly. The prompts ask for a three character text, background color, and a shape. The generator then creates a custom 300x200 logo. Instead of searching for copyright free logos or going through a painstaking process to make a handmade one, using this generator creates a personalized logo within seconds. This is a game-changer for web developers looking for a logo for their projects; however, the scope for the application of this generator is a lot grander. This could benefit business owners, organizations, and anybody that needs an emblem to represent them. Through the development of this project I was able to learn how to use node and the npm modules that can be installed. I also learned how to use the "fs" library to read and write files. In addition, I also became comfortable with using "inquirer" library and its prompt method.

## Setup and Usage
  In order to start the SVG generator, first you type "node index.js" in your terminal. Once this is completed a prompt of three questions will appear. Once the questions are answered the input wil be taken and used to generate a logo with a custom name. The custom name will feature the three letters entered into the first question. The newly made logo will show up in the "examples" folder. In order to make sure this generator works, the user should run "npm run test". This should result in 3 passed tests if the generator is functioning correctly.
